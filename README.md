# MassiveSkillTreeVisualization
Massive skill tree visualization is my attempt to create a massive skill tree in LÖVE.

Massive skill trees can be added to game to provide power ups, passive skills, item upgrades and anything imaginable.

This is not a plug and play implementation, It will need to be heavily modified by the end user.

# Setup
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pareshchouhan/MassiveSkillTreeVisualization.git
cd MassiveSkillTreeVisualization
love .
```

Made with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/)
